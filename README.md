# mars
This is a replica of McDonald's Activity Reporting System or MARS that McDonald's Corporation's Marketing team owns. This web program was created as a personal web-development project.

Currently, this program is at phase one which is to display all the promotions available.

Phase Two: Create new promotions. Edit an existing promotion. Only show children of USA in the Area drop down. Display only "active" promotions.
As of Dec 12, 2018, only feature left to implement is 'Update an existing promotion'.
Dec 13, 2018: Implemented the update feature.
Dec 20, 2018: Added default sorting for promotions and area.

Phase Three: Restrict promotion creation/modification and view based on user criteria (role and area).
